### Machine Learning for Materials Science  
The purpose of this project is to use machine learning and data visualisation tools to predict properties of the materials. My current project is dedicated to the perovskite materials with general chemcial formula of **ABO3**.   
The main source of information in my journey into the application of ML models in matreials science comes from amazing international project and its repositories, ***materials project***. (https://materialsproject.org/)  
The dataset is the result fo the nice work done by Antoine Emery, entitled *High-throughput DFT calculations of formation energy, stability and oxygen vacancy formation energy of ABO3 perovskites* and was published with DOI (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5334142.v1).  
The features in the dataset have different kinds of correlation together, some more linear relation, some non-linear, cluster based relation etc. I assume this is typical for many classes of the materials, as chemical and physical properties usually do not show linear correlation in the real world.  
To handle multiclass problem with different relationship among features, I think the use of Stacking Classifier might be the safer approach to get benefit of the potential of different models like regression, tree based etc.
